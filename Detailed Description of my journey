Day 1

Started my Day 1 of #100daysofcode challenge

I started my journey with learning Feature Scaling.
Feature Scaling is bringing down all the features to the same level.
Suppose we have height as a feature having magnitudes as 140cm and 7 feet.
We know obviously 7 feet is greater than 140cm.
But the algorithm doesn't know that.
It selects 140cm as the greater one since 140>7.
So We need feature scaling.
Which ML Algorithms Required Feature Scaling?
Those Algorithms Calculate Distance
•K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

•K-Means

•Support Vector Machine (SVM)

•Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

•Linear Discriminant Analysis

Gradient Descent Based Algorithms
•Linear Regression,

•Logistic Regression

•Neural Network

Tree Based Algorithms not required Feature scaling
•Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost

Types of Feature Scaling
•1) Min Max Scaler

•2) Standard Scaler

•3) Max Abs Scaler

•4) Robust Scaler

•5) Quantile Transformer Scaler

•6) Power Transformer Scaler

•7) Unit Vector Scaler
