-Started my Day 4 with the Neural Networks and Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai .

WEEK 1:

-Got to know that we use Standard Neural Networks for House Prediction ,Advertisement Prediction.

-Convolution Neural Networks are used for Image applications.

-Sequence Data(Audio),Language Conversions(ex:English->French),Time Series are considered as 1D data and use Recurrent Neural Network.

-Structured Data is a database of data in supervised learning.

-Unstructured data consists of Audio,Image,text in supervised learning.
